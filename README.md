EDA Classification Project

Overview

This project focuses on building and optimizing many ML MOdels for predicting outcomes in a given dataset. The goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy by fine-tuning the model and evaluating its performance through various techniques.

Project Objectives

Model Development: Develop a Random Forest classifier and explore its performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's parameters to improve accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Enhance the model by refining or creating new features.
Handling Class Imbalance: Address any imbalance in the dataset to improve model performance.
Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to achieve better results.
Evaluation: Use robust cross-validation to ensure reliable performance metrics.
